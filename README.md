# TermProbe

TermProbe allows to filter, search and plot data on terminal in real time.   

TermProbe is written in [Go](https://go.dev/). It is based on [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui) which is built on top of [termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go).   

# Run

Describe which file to monitor and regex pattern to match in data through **config.yml** file.  

Rename **_sample-config.yml_** to **_config.yml_** and make necessary configuration changes for plotting.  

To run,
```
go run .
```

This is a _work in progress_ project at the moment.
